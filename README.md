# Hi!
My name is Alex and I am an enthusiastic thrid year Engineering Physics student at Uppsala University seeking to immerse myself in diverse and challenging experiences, currently studying engineering physics as well as economics at Uppsala University while working as a piano instructor, TA, student representative and co-founder of SPEKTAKEL. 

On my Github I try to upload a mixture of coursework, projects, hackathon code, and other programming-related things I’ve worked on.
